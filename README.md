# cctalk
starting to throw together usable cctalk lib with encryption support


This is incomplete but functional I have added BNV encryption converted to python from https://github.com/vltgroup/ccTalk .
I will be adding des support to the library bit do far have only implented DES on SCH5

cctalk.py is the lib test.py currently is testing a coin mech . The other files are snippets from some of my older projects.  I will add a guide to usage once I get things more complete .
